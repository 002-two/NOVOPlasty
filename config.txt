Project name         = Choose a name for your project, it will be used for the output files.
Insert size          = Total insert size of your paired end reads, it doesn't have to be accurate but should be close enough.
Insert size auto     = (yes/no) This will finetune your insert size automatically (Default: yes)
Read Length          = The read length of your reads.
Type                 = (chloro/chloro2/mito) "chloro" for chloroplast assembly and "mito for mitochondrial assembly. It is     
                       recommended to first try "chloro", and if you don't get a circularized genome or it splits in to many
                       versions, to try "chloro2". This will create different contigs without circularizing
Genome Range         = (minimum genome size-maximum genome size) The expected genome size range of the genome.
                       Default value for mito: 12000-20000 / Default value for chloro: 120000-200000
                       If the expected size is know, you can lower the range, this can be useful when there is a repetitive
                       region, what could lead to a premature circularization of the genome.
K-mer                = (integer) This is the length of the overlap between matching reads (Default: 39). 
                       If reads are shorter then 90 bp, this value should be decreased. 
                       For reads longer then 101 bp, this value can be increased, but this is not necessary.
Insert Range         = This variation on the insert size, could lower it when the coverage is very high or raise it when the
                       coverage is too low (Default: 1.5). 
Insert Range strict  = Strict variation to resolve repetitive regions (Default: 1.2). 
Single/Paired        = For the moment only paired end reads are supported.
Coverage Cut off     = You can speed up the assembly by lowering the coverage cut off, standard it will use up to 1000 coverage
Extended log         = Prints out a very extensive log, could be useful to send me when there is a problem  (0/1).
Combined reads       = The path to the file that contains the combined reads (forward and reverse in 1 file)
Forward reads        = The path to the file that contains the forward reads
Reverse reads        = The path to the file that contains the reverse reads
Seed Input           = The path to the file that contains the seed sequence
